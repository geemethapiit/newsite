            <h1>SEA TURTLE HATCHERIES<br>
                SAVING THE ANCIENT MARINERS FROM PREDATORS:<br><br>
               </h1>
                <p>The World Sea Turtle Day 2018 was celebrated on June 16, emphasizing the importance of saving these ancient mariners. Of the seven sea turtle species in the world, five of them come to Sri Lankan shores for nesting. According to the World Wildlife Organization, all species of sea turtles are classified endangered and are slaughtered for their meat, eggs, skin, shell and their existence is threatened by poaching and over exploitation. Sea turtle hatcheries have become sanctuaries that provide safety to these sea turtles from human or other predators and environmental hazards. Tourists who visited the hatcheries were blown away by the experience, with some saying they were able to touch baby turtles that were 2 to 3 days old.

                    Mitchel, a volunteer, said that when she arrived at the hatchery, about a hundred of baby sea turtles were swimming in small tanks.<br><br> Environmentalist Supun Jayaweera is concerned about the popularity of sea turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka. He calls them "rackets" that dodge all good practices of a proper conservation project and are functional thanks to political interferences. Jayaweera points out that the sex ratio of the sea turtles has undergone drastic imbalances due to unsystematic digging up of eggs from their natural nests. He also points out that the hatcheries are violating the Fauna and Flora Ordinance by not abiding by its provisions.
                    
                    Unregulated Professor Devaka Weerakoon of the Zoology Department, Colombo University also points out that absence of proper regulations on sea turtle hatcheries has created a cobra effect. <br><br>The concept of sea turtle hatcheries was developed to convert potential exploiters to conservationists, but proper regulation is lacking. Egg collectors lack basic awareness on protocols to follow when removing eggs from their natural nests. Studies have found that sea turtles have a unique physical feature to identify the location of their nesting grounds, which allows them to imprint on their birth beach and scurry towards the water as soon as they are born. This condition is called juvenile frenzy, and the hatchlings have a natural store of energy given to them.</p><br><br>
